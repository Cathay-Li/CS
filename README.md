Grade 10 Animation is an immaturely developed python animation using pygame. The topic is surrounding basketball and friendship. The uncertainty of the actions made this animation hilarious and funny.

Grade 11 Culminating, _The Guessing Game_, is a time-killing game made in python. It requires little to no skills and lots of fortune. Give it a try since it is interesting!

** Both are individually made and ideas are original.
