Grade 10 Animation is an immaturely developed Python animation using Pygame. The topic is surrounding basketball and friendship. The uncertainty of the actions made this animation hilarious.

Grade 11 Culminating, _The Guessing Game_, is a time-killing game made in Python. It requires little to no skills and lots of fortune. Give it a try since it is interesting!

** Both are individually made and ideas are original.
